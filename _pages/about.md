I am a PhD candidate working with Dr. Xucong Zhang and Dr. Jan van Gemert at the Computer Vision Lab of Delft University of Technology. I obtained my Master of Science (cum laude) in Computer Science at Delft University of Technology, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests are centered around applied computer vision, currently focusing on using deep learning techniques for detecting various properties of human bodies and their pose.
