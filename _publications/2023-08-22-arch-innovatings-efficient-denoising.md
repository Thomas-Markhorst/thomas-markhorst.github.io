excerpt: 'In this paper, we combine image denoising and classification, aiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices, like security cameras. Since edge devices have little computational power, we also optimize for efficiency by proposing a novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers, to search for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Our NAS architectures outperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and classification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Moreover, our approach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like medical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.'
